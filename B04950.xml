            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For it is not ſo neceſſary in Religion, to be inſtructed in all its Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and to believe aright, as it is duly to obey and ſerve God: nor is every wrong Opinion ſo dangerous, as falſe and miſtaken Worſhip. If a Phyſician ſhould proclaim himſelf for <hi>infallible,</hi> the reputation of his skill would quickly ſink, if he failed ordinarily in the <hi>Regiment of Health,</hi> and made more Diſtempers than he cured. And no wiſe Traveller would chuſe him for the Guide of his way, who though he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew every ſtep of it, yet was wont to lead thoſe whom he conducted, to repoſe themſelves under Tree of unhealthful ſhade and influence; and to bring them, for the quenching their thirſt, to thoſe Springs whoſe Waters were neither clear nor wholeſome.

<q rend="inline">She was not only elected by God, but pre-elected before all others, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 6.8,9. <hi>There are Sixty Queens, and Eighty Concubines, and Virgins without number: My Beloved, my undefiled is but one, the only one of her Mother, the choice one of her that bare her.</hi> 2. That ſhe was promiſed by Heaven to the Fathers, prefigured by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Miracles, foretold by Prophetick Oracles, and by the Sybils was honourably predicted. 3. That ſhe ſprang by the kindneſs of God from barren Parents, that vowed to give to God the Off-ſpring he ſhould beſtow on them; that an Angel foretold her Nativity to her Parents, which we do not read in the Scriptures concerning any other Woman,</q> 
               <hi>(no nor of her neither there.)</hi>
               <q rend="inline">4. That ſhe only of all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of
<hi>Adam,</hi> that deſcended from him by the ordinary way of Propagation
<hi>(per ſeminalem rationem)</hi> was free from Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin. 5. That in the very beginning of her immaculate Conception, ſhe was ſo confirmed in Grace, that ever after ſhe was without ſtain of actual, though but venial, Sin. 6. That the <hi>Fomes peccati,</hi> that which like Tinder ſo ſoon kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in us, was extinct in her; ſo that ſhe never was ſenſible of that Tyrannous Law of the Members, or the Rebellion of the lower Part. 7. That in her very Conception ſhe had the uſe of Reaſon, and made a Vow of Virginity to God; from which inſtant alſo ſhe began to merit, and that the merit of her Works was never interrupted, no not ſo much as in her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:176007:9"/>ſleep. 8. That in the ſame Conception of hers ſhe was adorned with all Theological and Cardinal Vertues; and that in that Heroick Degree, as well as with all the <hi>gratiae gratis datae,</hi> graces freely given. 9. That at the Age of Three Years ſhe was in the Temple, according to her Parents Vow, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and there was moſt holily Educated.
10. That this Bleſſed Perſon among Women, eſcaped all that Curſe to which mankind, by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, was obnoxious. 11. That ſhe alone, that had conceived without any luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaſure, did not undergo the Irkſomneſs that other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child are ſubject to. 12. That by a Virgin Birth ſhe brought forth God without pain. 13. That the Lord's Body exhibited in the H. Euchariſt, is formed of her Blood in her Virgin Womb, which therefore is compared, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. to a <hi>heap of Wheat ſet about with Lilies.</hi> 14. That ſhe in a ſingular manner did many ways co-operate to our Salvation. 15. That the Fruit of Chriſt's Paſſion was in a ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner communicated to her, and ſtanding courageouſly by the Croſs of her Son, was pierced through with the Sword of grief, and therefore ſhe firſt of all ſaw Chriſt when he aroſe from the Dead. 16. That ſhe was the Inſtructer and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of the Apoſtles and Teachers. 17. That her Body did not ſee Corruption; but being aſſumed and taken up to Heaven in Body and Soul before the common Reſurrection, ſhe was placed above the Choires of Angels and Orders of Saints, at the Right-hand of her Son, where ſhe makes a diſtinct Order
<hi>(Chorus)</hi> above them all, and ſhe alone obtained more glory than all the reſt of the Saints and Angels put together. 18. That her preſence brought a great deal of accidental Joy to the Bleſſed in Heaven. 19. That ſhe is the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Lady</hi> of all the Angels and Saints. 20. That ſhe is the common Advocate of Sinners, the Mother of Mercy, the Mediatrix to intercede for them; and that ſhe is alſo the Mother of the Living, and promotes the Salvation of all Men. 21. That ſhe is ſo formidable and terrible to the Devils, that they preſently fly away at the mention of her Name, and much more at her Command; and that ſhe hath powerfully broken their Head. 22. That all the Graces and Privileges that are diſperſed among other Saints, are found united in her, after a far more perfect manner.</q> Thus <pb n="10" facs="tcp:176007:10"/>far he. But others

<note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. c 2.</note> that it was more wonderful than this, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from Chriſt's Divinity; for only

<q rend="inline">Becauſe ſhe in her Mother's Womb was filled with Wiſdom, Prudence, Underſtanding, and the reſt of the Gifts of the Divine Spirit, above all the moſt aged.</q> But to tell us, that then her Grace exceeded the Meaſures of Angels and of Saints conſummate in Bliſs, is ſuch wild Divinity, as one would ſcarce look to meet with any where, unleſs from him that for half an Hour together cries <hi>Glory, Glory</hi> in

                  <p>Another Reaſon they reſerve as a Secret, though I doubt not but it is intended in all theſe Aſſertions, <hi>viz.</hi> The making her in every thing that is poſſible like unto Chriſt himſelf; that ſo, when their Lines run ſo parallel, they may the more plauſibly call her, a <hi>Helper,</hi> a <hi>Co-worker,</hi> a <hi>Co-redeemer,</hi> or what ever other Name they uſe, to ſignify how much we are engaged to her in promoting our Salvation.</p>

<note n="d" place="margin">Franciſcus a Chriſto. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. de Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. fol. 189.</note> has given us an account of Three Opinions among them, and all of them very favourable to her. The Severeſt is that of S.
<hi>Thomas,</hi>
                     <q rend="inline">who thinks that ſhe was in Sin for a time (but ſo ſhort a time that none can meaſure it) to wit, ſo much time as intervenes between two Moments <hi>(inter duo inſtantia;)</hi> for in the firſt Inſtant of her Conception, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Original Stain; in the next Moment after it, ſhe was purged from it; ſo that ſhe was obnoxious to Sin only the time that muſt come between thoſe Two Moments. Others think that the Bleſſed Virgin was a whole Moment of Time in Sin
<hi>(integro temporis inſtanti,)</hi> but all the time that is coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that Inſtant, was in Grace, and ſo grant that her Son delivered his Mother from Guilt, as ſoon as it was poſſible for Divine Omnipotency to effect it.</q> This will not pleaſe the <hi>Immaculiſts;</hi> for this Reaſon, becauſe if they ſay that the firſt Inſtant ſhe was in Sin, tho they grant that in the next <pb n="58" facs="tcp:176007:34"/>Inſtant Grace was infuſed to take it away; yet becauſe two Inſtants (according to the Philoſopher, 6
<hi>Phyſic.</hi>) cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cohere (no more than Two Atoms in continued Quantity) without a middle Time between them, therefore the Bleſſed Virgin muſt be in Sin according to this Opinion, not only the firſt Inſtant, but alſo the time between that and the ſecond. But he ſays there are a third Sort (and they are the very Pinks of Courteſy) who come thus far as to ſay,
<q rend="inline">That in the firſt Inſtant in which ſhe contracted Guilt, ſhe was alſo delivered from the ſame by God: Only they crave Leave to divide an Inſtant into Three <hi>(in tria Signa):</hi> In the firſt of which ſhe contracted Sin; in the ſecond ſanctifying Grace was infuſed into her Soul, but more incompleat and tranſient, abiding with Sin, but ready to expel it: In the third the ſame Grace is underſtood as permanent, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to have expelled Sin.</q> This indeed is too ſubtil to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, yet however one would think, it ſhould be kindly taken by thoſe of the other Opinion; ſince, if they will but allow them the third Part of a Moment for her ſtay under the Original Guilt, they then declare her to be as immaculate as the other can imagine her to be: And if the one Party appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends a Wound to be given to the Honour of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by the Suppoſition of her being under that Sin, it is healed, you ſee, by the other in far leſs time, than the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye, or the quickneſs of the ſwifteſt Thought. And yet after all, I aſſure you, it is morally certain that theſe Two Parties will never be pieced together, but eternally quarrel. Freſh Combatants appear every day upon the Stage, and they charge one another ſo furiouſly, and engage the People in ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Quarrel, that neither <hi>General Council</hi> nor <hi>Pope</hi> (whom both ſides acknowledge only capable of doing it) dare decide this doughty Matter, for fear of worſe Conſequences to enſue thereupon.

And hence it appears, that that Concupiſcence by which Chriſt would not be conceived, did cauſe in Mankind an evil Off-ſpring; and altho the Body of</hi> Mary <hi>came from thence, yet ſhe did not tranſmit it into the Body which did not conceive from thence. Now from hence it is that the Body of Chriſt is ſaid to be in the Likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, becauſe all other Fleſh of Men is ſinful: Whoſo denies this, and ſo compares the Fleſh of Chriſt with the Fleſh of other Men that are born, as to aſſert that both are of equal Purity, he is found to be a deteſtable Heretick.</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,

He tells them, That though their Opinion be not <hi>heretical,</hi> nor contains <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin</hi> in the holding of it; yet it gives juſt Occaſion of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Bleſſed Virgin, ſo that they may well expect ſhe ſhould be leſs favourable and propitious to them, which, ſays he, they ought extreamly to dread. Now that ſo it is, is plain by this Inſtance: Suppoſe a Controverſy depended before a Judge concerning the Nobility of a Perſon, which though the Judge did not abſolutely define, yet if he declared that it was very probable that he was a noble Perſon, and he ſhould take it more kindly, if he were accounted and treated as ſuch; would it not be ſufficient Cauſe of Diſtaſt, if he to whom the Judge had been ſo favourable, could not obtain that Honour which is ſo encouraged? This is the Bleſſed Virgins Caſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly; every one has Liberty given him by the Church to think thus honourably of her; and the Church has encouraged the paying of it, by ſpiritual Indulgences; and has not the Bleſſed Virgin reaſon then to be ſomewhat diſpleaſed and angry with thoſe that ſtill deny it?</p>

<hi>Milan,</hi> importuned him earneſtly, that in defence of the Bleſſed Virgin's Innocency, he would ſuffer them to make that Trial with their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by entring into the Fire; he did not think there was any canonical Prohibition of ſuch Experiments, becauſe (as his

Yet he would not give his Conſent; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Bleſſed Virgin could other ways defend her Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and partly believing that the Impugners would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Propoſal; or if they ſhould, that they would have been ſuddenly burnt (concluding ſo, I ſuppoſe, by what had happened before in the like caſe.)</p>
                  <p>Another Miracle he mentions,
<note n="h" place="margin">Id. ib. p. 82.</note> a very remarkable one, and how he came to be acquainted with it, of one Friar
<hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas de Bohemia,</hi> that had one of his Legs dried up, and utterly infeebled <hi>(omni vigore deſtituta)</hi> ſo that he deſpaired of a Cure, and was adviſed by the Phyſicians to have it cut off: But in this Diſtreſs he betook himſelf to the Bleſſed Virgin and pray'd, <hi>That ſhe would reſtore Soundneſs to him for the Praiſe of her immaculate Conception:</hi> In honour of which he celebrated a Maſs, ſtanding in great Torment upon one Foot: When the Maſs was ended he was perfectly cured and freed from his old Infirmity; ſo that he who before could not go, came without Help to <hi>Rome</hi> on foot, and this Morning, ſays

<hi>yet it is not to be denyed that both of them are very fit Motives, and may be look'd upon to have a kind of Sprinkling of divine Authority upon them (Divina authoritate aliquatenus perfuſum.)</hi> The plain Meaning of which is, That God cannot deliver his Mind fully to us, ſo as to engage us peremptorily to believe him, though it may be prudent to do ſo, unleſs he deliver his Mind by the<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176007:44"/>

A Man might ſwear that he is not urging <hi>us</hi> with this Argument of Miracles, but intends this as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>ſomewhere elſe,</hi> as the Words following do inform us: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>if it were ſo, then it muſt be granted that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition affirming the Bleſſed Virgin's Conception to have been Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, has the Certainty of Faith for it, which it's plain cannot be we affirmed, becauſe of the Silence of the Church</hi> (that is, with a Jeſuit, of the Pope) <hi>in this matter.</hi> And he adds, <hi>That he does very piouſly, who from hence gives a from Aſſent to it,</hi> ſed infra certitudinem divinae fidei,
<hi>but ſhort of the Certainty of Divine Faith.</hi> Thoſe Words then of
<hi>pious Aſſent</hi> and <hi>prudential Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and ſuch like, are Tricks and only Words of Courſe; for one <hi>of the Church</hi> may believe in this Caſe either way, and has free Leave to do it, without being condemned: So that God may do what Miracles he pleaſes on one ſide, and yet a Man may ſafely be on the other ſide, till the <hi>Pope</hi> contradicts it: So that it is <hi>He</hi> plainly that can only oblige him to believe to Purpoſe. Which gives me occaſion to reflect upon a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond good Uſe that the former Conſiderations of Miracles and Revelations will afford us,
<hi>viz.</hi> A plain Diſcovery of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiveneſs of their unerring Guide, infallible Judge, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of Controverſies in ſome Caſes. For thoſe Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have but little to ſay to any but
<hi>him,</hi> and <hi>he,</hi> when he pleaſes, has nothing to ſay notwithſtanding <hi>them.</hi> If one ſhould be ſo bold to queſtion the Pope after S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s manner: Doſt thou believe Miracles and Revelations in this Affair of the Bleſſed Virgin? I doubt the Anſwer could not be returned ſo eaſily, <hi>I know thou believeſt.</hi> He is not ſo quickly underſtood I aſſure you, nor his Mind ſo eaſily known: He has often put on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faces, and by his various Appearances given Occaſion to complain, <hi>Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo?</hi> Yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we have ſome good hold of him, and ſhall not eaſily let it go.</p>

                  <p>For either the Pope believes thoſe Miracles, Viſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations for the Proof of the Immaculate Conception (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in thoſe) or he does not. If he does not believe them, ſurely we are fairly excuſed from being concerned about them, ſince he has greater Opportunities than we can have, to find out their Cheat if they be forged; and if they were true, his Faith ſhould be the forwardeſt: But if he does believe them, then the Matter is worſe, conſidering the Place he ſits in; for he pretends to be the unerring Guide (as I ſaid) of Faith, the Judge and Determiner of Controverſies. It is boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Privilege of his Church, that its Differences can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be endleſs (though thoſe of other Churches may) for here is one appointed to decide them, and his Deciſion liable to no Miſtake. Very good: And why is not this Controverſy then determined? It has been a Controverſy in his Church of Four hundred Years ſtanding, and yet every Judge in Succeſſion that has ſate in this Chair has been dumb, and his Infallibility lain by, and no Body has been the better for it. It cannot be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his behalf, That the thing is not weighty enough to be determined, and to become an Article of Catholick Faith; for whatſoever <hi>we</hi> may think of it, yet he dares not own that <hi>he</hi> thinks ſo, when it is about a glorious Privilege of the Bleſſed Virgin; and when he is now ſuppoſed to believe the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Miracles to be Divine that do atteſt it; for God ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does not uſe to interpoſe in that manner about Trifles. He cannot be excuſed neither for hiding this precious Talent of his, and not employing it for want of a ſufficient Call thereto: For beſides that loud one of Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he is quick enough of hearing when he has a mind to canonize a Saint, or inſtitute a Feſtival; he has been loudly ſummoned to exerciſe his judging Faculty, by the Crys and Beſeechings of all ſorts both high and low, to pity the divided Church and heal its Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to becalm the boyſterous Tempeſt, that has threatned to ſink the Ship of the Church, by one powerful Word of his; but all in vain: He lies as one in a dead Sleep, and nothing can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken him.

<hi>Mary's</hi> Conception was not more pure than that of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> He added, it was a vain thing to diſſemble the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and not to take away the Cauſe of it, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would end in Contempt of

<note place="margin">P. 113</note> among other things, he urged the Pope withal to make a Deciſion, he mentioned this, That hereby the Truth of thoſe many Miracles wrought by God and the Saints in teſtimony of the immaculate Conception, would be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and the Certainty of many Revelations confirmed. <hi>(Which was well urged, ſince any one would think they themſelves did not give Credit to what they would have us believe, when the Pope knows not what to ſay to the Matter after all.)</hi>

That every Doctor might erre, which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſes of himſelf, and if S.
<hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> had lived now, he would have been of another Mind; and he concluded,

                  <hi>That there was none after the Apoſtles who were not Popes that might not erre:</hi> And then turning to the Pope, <hi>In thee alone, and the Biſhops in thy Chair, no Error has Place, in thee Truth is eſtabliſhed, and in thy Seat has ſet up her venerable and perpetual Throne; from that Throne no Lye can ever ariſe.</hi> After he had thus flattered the Pope, he obtained of him a Book of <hi>P. de Vincentia</hi> a Dominican, in which the Sayings of the Fathers were collected for the <hi>Maculiſt</hi>'s Opinion, which were taken out of Two Books of
<hi>Vinc. Bandellus,</hi> which fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed the immaculate Conception. And the Orator en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in a Fifth Paper to ſhow, that theſe Books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch things as were condemned by the Bull of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. Particularly he gave in the Heads of <hi>Bandellus</hi> his Books, which contained the ſevereſt Charges againſt the Opinion of the
<hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculiſts;</hi> as that it was a mortal Error, full of Falſity, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Pernicious; that it was injurious to the Blood of Chriſt, making her neither to be reconciled nor juſtified by it; that an Opinion founded in the holy Scriptures, was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Determinations of Pope and Council; That the <hi>Immaculiſts</hi> did contradict Scripture, and perniciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved them, and defended the Hereſy of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in their Expoſitions: He affirms,
<note place="margin">P. 134.</note> That the Perſons to whom
<hi>Revelations</hi> are ſaid to be made, concerning the Virgin's immaculate Conception, were ſuſpected Perſons, addicted to carnal Vices, and diſcovering that they had nothing of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in them:
<note place="margin">P. 140.</note> That the Miracles brought to confirm it, were wrought by the Devil, who, by God's Permiſſion, healed ſome Infirmities upon invoking the immaculate Conception; that ſo he that was Filthy might be Filthy ſtill. After many ſuch Charges (which may be ſeen in the Hiſtory) he produced the Teſtimonies of Two hundred and ſixty famous Doctors who were againſt it: This Work of <hi>Bandelis,</hi> which was in many Hands that made ill uſe of it, the Embaſſador urged, that it <pb n="86" facs="tcp:176007:48"/>might by an Edict be put among the Catalogue of prohibited Books. But the Pope made anſwer, That the Conſtitution of
<hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. (which begins <hi>Grave nimis, &amp;c.</hi>) was ſufficient.</p>
               <p>After this the Embaſſador put in a Sixth Paper,
<note place="margin">P. 149.</note> to prove, that the Difference of the Adverſaries in celebrating the Feaſt of the Conception, was not to be tolerated, and that it was fit they ſhould be commanded to celebrate it unanimouſly with the univerſal Church. The Pope returned that he had often dealt about it, and deſired that this Myſtery might be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated by all; but it was always anſwered by the <hi>Macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> That they did the ſame with others under the Name of <hi>Her Sanctification</hi> (not Conception) which comprehended all. Whereupon in a Seventh Speech,
<note place="margin">P. 172.</note> the Orator endeavoured to ſhow, That the Catholick Church in the Feaſt of the Bleſſed Virgin's Conception, did now, and always, intend nothing elſe thereby, than to celebrate her Preſervation from original Sin, ſo that in no Inſtant ſhe was actually ſubject to it. The Pope ſaid he did not doubt of this, that the Church intended by their Worſhip of the Conception to profeſs that

                  </gap>, and the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ever after got Ground of it: After this he endeavoured to prove his own Opinion about the immaculate Conception, by various Reaſons, too large to be repeated. The Pope made<pb n="87" facs="tcp:176007:48"/>Anſwer,
<note place="margin">P. 234.</note> That he acknowledged the great Probability of the <hi>Immaculiſt</hi>'s Opinion, and that its State and Terms were better; but the Adverſaries ſtill maintained, That theirs ſtill kept its Place, and had not loſt all Probability, nor that the
<hi>pious Opinion</hi> was ſo undoubted and irrefragable, that for its Sake the Contrary ſhould be exploded: Nay they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, That if it ſhould come to a Definition (which ſome ſay is impoſſible) that the Sentence muſt needs go on their Side, becauſe of the Authority of the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Doctors,</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas;</hi> nor that it could, at leaſt ought not, be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for the <hi>Pious one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Embaſſador not being yet ſatisfied, he adds a Ninth Treatiſe,
<note place="margin">P. 236.</note> to prove that the Controverſy concerning the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi>'s Conception might be ended by a definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Church, and that no other Sentence, but for her immaculate Conception, could be propounded by the Church with certainty of Faith; and gave many Reaſons to ſhew the Expediency of doing it as ſoon as might be. The Pope reply'd,
<note place="margin">P. 289.</note> That there was no need of Arguments to prove that the Controverſy was capable of Deciſion; he knew well how much he was able to do in it; neither did he doubt of his Power, but of the Conveniency and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of defining it; That this was by no means a fit Seaſon for the Examination and exact Determination of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Thus things ſtood whilſt this Embaſſador managed them:

               <p>Another Paper he put in,
<note place="margin">P. 375.</note> to ſhow that the Pope was
<hi>bound by his Office,</hi> to provide a timely Remedy for theſe great and growing Scandals, ariſing from the Liberty of opining in this Controverſy of the Bleſſed Virgin's Conception, and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating the

               <p>The Hiſtory further tells us, That in <hi>Spain</hi> the Scandals ſtill increaſing, and Cities and People being divided into Factions, ſome Academies, and rich Cities, and whole Kingdoms did bind themſelves by Oaths and Vows, to defend the Opinion of the immaculate Conception; and we are told by others

               <p>After all this Stir and doing nothing; the former Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor took his Leave of the Pope; who told him that he was ſorry that he could not ſatisfy the Kings pious Wiſhes in this Matter:
<hi>But,</hi> he ſaid,

                  <hi>that which was deſired, was not of that ſort of things, which is within the Limits of humane Diligence, or which by reaſon of Neceſſity, or worldly Inſtances, or the Power of Kings may preſently be granted, until the Spirit from on high ſhall infuſe, what in ſuch a weighty Controverſy ought to be gravely and maturely deliberated.</hi> Now ſhame on this vile Hypocriſy; who when every one may ſee this Matter wholly conducted by Intereſt, and cowardly fear of diſobliging a powerful Party, <pb n="90" facs="tcp:176007:50"/>dares to talk of the <hi>Spirit from on high,</hi> and imitate the fulſome Language of a

               </p>
               <p>When this Embaſſador was gone, <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> upon whom the whole Care of this Affair was devolved, inſiſts upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and receives the ſame delatory Anſwers from Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V.
<note place="margin">P. 431.</note> who, upon the fourth Calends of

<hi>Gregory</hi> XV. to whom this Duke applies himſelf in the Name of his Maſter; who commending, as his Predeceſſor had done, the Piety of the King, told him, he would comply with him, when time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Things, after a foregoing grave Examination of the Matter, would give him leave.</p>
               <p>But preſently after <hi>Philip</hi> III. of <hi>Spain</hi> dies, and choſe to do it in the Habit of a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> and left the care of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> IV. his Succeſſor, who confirmed <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>About this time, not only the old Conteſts and Scandals which troubled <hi>Spain,</hi> but a new Occaſion of an extraordinary Embaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> made the King to ply the former Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He writes therefore to <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> to urge the Buſineſs, and give the Letter to the Pope which he ſent.

<hi>Infanta of Spain,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the Emperor, all wrote to the Pope. The Embaſſador had a Hearing, and a general Anſwer of good Hope was given him, That the Pope thought of nothing now, but to remove thoſe Scandals that continued,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> A while after a new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>(Comes Montis Regij)</hi> arrives at <hi>Rome:</hi> He was ſent thither to aſſiſt at the Canonization of Five new Saints (Four of which were <hi>Spaniards</hi>)
<hi>Iſadore</hi> of <hi>Madrid, Ignatius Loyola, Fran. Xaverius, Tereſia à Jeſu;</hi> and one <hi>Italian, Philip Nereus.</hi> This
<hi>Count</hi> was brought in to the Pope in great State and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifice,
<note place="margin">P. 443.</note> and begged in Favour to him, that the Pope would put his laſt Hand to this Buſineſs; who promiſed that ſomething ſhould be done in it before his Departure. And in order to it ſeveral Cardinals were appointed, to whom their Deſires ſhould be propoſed. Two things they offered to them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was more deſirable that the Controverſy might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If by the ſtraitneſs of Time that could not be done, then in the Interim, that whatſoever did ſeem to contradict the immaculate Conception, might be removed and<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176007:50"/>baniſhed from Diſcourſes and Worſhip, in all Acts both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, otherwiſe Matters would never be pacified in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinals approved of what they deſired, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to the Pope; who, in a full Congregation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Inquiſition, approved the Cardinals Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout prohibiting in all Acts the maintaining of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Opinion, which gave the People Offence, and taking away the Word
<hi>Sanctification</hi> out of the Office of the Church. And upon <hi>May</hi>
24. 1622. came forth a Decree,
<note place="margin">P. 447.</note> which repeating thoſe of
<hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. and <hi>Paul</hi> V. and confirming them, farther command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That for the future, till this Article ſhould be determined by the Apoſtolick Chair, neither in private Diſcourſes, or in Writings, any one ſhould dare to aſſert that the Bleſſed Virgin was conceived in original Sin; nor handle any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Opinion, excepting only thoſe, who were ſpecially privileged herein by the Pope. Alſo his Holineſs command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That ſince the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church celebrates ſolemnly the Feaſt and Office of the Conception of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> That all Perſons Eccleſiaſtical and Secular, and thoſe of every Order, in the holy Sacrifice of the Maſs and other divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices both publick and private, ſhould uſe no other Word but that of
<hi>Conception,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Sanctification, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now again the <hi>Immaculiſts,</hi> after this Decree,

               <p>On the Fourth of <hi>June</hi> 1622.
<note place="margin">P. 451.</note> a Brief of the Popes was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſent to the King, ſignifying, after the Commendation of his Piety, how far he had proceeded in this Affair, out of a Deſire to bring ſome Comfort to him and his Kingdoms. But then he adds, in the former canting Strain,
<hi>That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he did not determine any thing new at preſent, was the weightineſs of the Affair, and the Example of the Popes his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors: For we, who are placed by God over the Chriſtian World, in the Chair of Chriſtian Wiſdom, ought to hearken to the Voice of the holy Spirit, and not examine the Matter by the Poiſes of humane Reaſons: Wherefore, ſeeing the eternal Wiſdom has not yet diſcovered to the Church the Receſſes of ſo great a Myſtery, <pb n="92" facs="tcp:176007:51"/>the faithful People ought to reſt ſatisfied in the Authority of God and the</hi> Roman
<hi>Popes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The King ſent his Letters of Thanks to the Pope, dated
<hi>July</hi> 14. 1622.
<note place="margin">P. 453.</note> and in like manner to the Cardinal Inquiſitors; intreating them to uſe the ſame Endeavours in what remained, till his Holineſs would vouchſafe to define the Controverſy. And now all <hi>Spain</hi> ſounded their Gladneſs and erected their Trophies, and nothing but Expreſſions of Joy were ſeen or heard for ſeveral Months together.</p>
               <p>But all this Joy was interrupted at <hi>Barcenona, Caeſar-Auguſta,</hi> and other Parts of the Kingdom,
<note place="margin">P. 455.</note> by reaſon of a Grant the Pope made and which was publickly affixed, according to the Clauſe of the foregoing Conſtitution <hi>(excepting thoſe to whom the Pope ſhould give a ſpecial Indulgence)</hi> wherein he gave this Privilege to the
<hi>Dominicans</hi> notwithſtanding the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That <hi>in any of their private Conferences among themſelves, and none elſe, they might freely and lawfully handle the Matter of the Bleſſed Virgins Conception, without incurring the Penalties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſaid Decrees.</hi> Which was dated 22 <hi>July</hi> 1622. This Grant, ſays the Author of the Hiſtory, troubled many who would have had the pious Opinion ſecured and put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Doubt; but he hopes, that thoſe to whom the Pope gave this laſt Indulgence, will not abuſe it, nor break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open Scandals, when the Permiſſion reaches no further, than to private Colloquies.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen the buſy Management of a Four Years Embaſſy, ending juſt where it began; and made a pleaſant Piece of formal Pageantry: Great Charity and Piety pretended by Two Kings, anſwered with Deceit and pious Frauds, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently intended by Two Popes. We have ſeen pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility ſitting in a Chair of State, and ſaying nothing: A fierce Controverſy brought before an unerring Judge, who will let no body determine ſuch Matters without or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf; and when all earneſtly expect how he will end it, he tires them with Delays, or deceives them with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anſwers. In a Word, I verily believe that this Judge of Controverſies, has ſet a foot Ten, for one he has ever decided: For though he calls this laſt his Office, yet he is as hardly brought to this Work, as a Bear is to the Stake; and when he is, he is either fearful of the Conſequents, and dares not ſpeak<pb n="93" facs="tcp:176007:51"/>out, or ſullen and will not, or crafty and puts it off, and ſays he cannot do it yet, (as in the Caſe before us, which I ſuppoſe he will leave for the day of Judgment to decide) or if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that once in an Age he gives us a Caſt of his Office, as he hath done in this Age, in the Caſe of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Parties might have done as wiſely to have referred the Matter to a Lottery, or the Chance of a Die, as bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtand to this blind Award; for after his Deciſion they find ſuch manifeſt Defects either of Skill or Honeſty, That thoſe who are condemned, ſee no reaſon to retract or alter their Opinion, and oftentimes are ſo bold as to declare and prove him to have been miſtaken.</p>
               <p>But though the Popes are reſolved not to define the Opinion of the <hi>Immaculiſts</hi> to be <hi>de fide,</hi> yet it is a great Comfort to them, that the Church has ſhewed a greater Propenſion and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this than the contrary. The <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council of Baſil</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Seſſ. 36.</note> ſpake all their Mind, when they determined plainly for it, <hi>That ſhe was free from all Sin original and actual, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that this Opinion ought to be approved, held and embraced of all Catholicks as pious and agreeable to the Churches Worſhip, to the Catholick Faith, right Reaſon and Holy Scripture, and that it ſhall be lawful for none to preach and teach the contrary.</hi> What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Chance was it, that this Decree was not anticipated Three Seſſions; for then their Work might have been effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done? Whereas having in the Thirty fourth Seſſion depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the lawful Pope

<note n="c" place="margin">Raynaudus ubi ſupra p. 135.</note> out of the Acts of S. <hi>Oringa (alias Chriſtiana)</hi> who died in <hi>Etruria An.</hi> 1310. how this Feaſt was celebrated in Heaven, being made known to her by a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For ſhe was rapt up in an Ecſtaſy into Heaven, and ſaw the bleſſed Virgin ſitting on a bright Throne by her Son, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moſt precious Garment, with all the Saints rejoicing about her and keeping a ſolemn Feaſt. <hi>Oringa</hi> admiring the Cauſe of all this, and the whiteneſs of the Garment wherein the mother of God ſhone, Chriſt himſelf gave her an account of it, That on that Day they kept in Heaven the Feaſt of her <hi>immaculate Conception,</hi> who remaining a Virgin conceived and bore him who is the true God and Man, and that the whiteneſs of her Garment denoted the Prerogative of her ſingular Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>Now what ſlender Credit is to be given to theſe Stories of Apparitions and Revelations, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> will tell us; who, it ſeems, himſelf had met with them, and treats them very courſly in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Canons of</hi> Lyons
<note n="d" place="margin">Epiſt. 174.</note>. <hi>They produce a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of heavenly Revelation, as they call it: As if any one might not, in like manner produce a Writing, in which the Virgin ſeem'd to command the ſame thing</hi> (<hi>ſc.</hi> the obſerving a Feaſt) <hi>for her Parents, according to Gods Command ſaying, Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> (Little did he imagine that <hi>Joachim</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> ſhould have had a Feſtival appointed for them, when he<pb n="100" facs="tcp:176007:55"/>wrote this, which was not then thought of) <hi>I am not apt to be moved by ſuch Writings, which are neither back'd with Reaſon nor favoured by certain Authority.</hi> And it's very obſervable that the Credit of this Feaſt decayed in a little time, even here in <hi>England,</hi> where it was firſt obſerved: For in a Council held by <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> Arch-Biſhop, at <hi>Oxford An.</hi> 1222. it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<note n="e" place="margin">Concil. Labbetom. 11. part. 1. p.

                  <hi>That all the Feaſts of bleſſed</hi> Mary <hi>ſhould be kept, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Feaſt of the Conception, for the celebrating of which no Neceſſity is impoſed.</hi> In this Council it is left at
<hi>Liberty;</hi> and in another Synod, a while after, at <hi>Worceſter An.</hi> 1240. under <hi>Walter de Cantilupo</hi> the Biſhop there, where the Feaſts of his Dioceſs are mentioned, this is left out
<note n="f" place="margin">Thiers. ibid. c. 20. p. 105.</note>, and the ſame Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod reckoning the Feaſts of the Church of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> does alſo again omit this.</p>
               <p>The earlieſt time in any other Church, is the Obſervation of it in <hi>France, An.</hi> 1215. in a Decree of <hi>Galo</hi> and
<hi>Simon,</hi> Legates of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. related by
<hi>Bochellus</hi>

<hi>Thiers</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. p. 323.</note>, argues that it was not obſerved in <hi>France</hi> before that Synod, for then it would have only been recited, as other Feaſts there are, without adjoining this ſpecial Admonition.</p>
               <p>But all this reaches only to ſome particular Churches, not to the univerſal Obſervation of it; for it was oppoſed as an Innovation by many, and great Men. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> is very ſharp againſt it (in the forecited Epiſtle to the <hi>Canons of Lyons.</hi>)
<q rend="inline">We wonder, ſays he, what ſome of you mean, to bring in a new Solemnity, which the Cuſtom of the Church is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, which Reaſon does not prove, nor ancient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commend. What are we more learned or Devout than the Fathers? We dangerouſly preſume whatſoever in ſuch things their Prudence did paſs by. And if ſo, what reaſon for the Feaſt of the Conception? How, I ſay, can her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be aſſerted to be Holy, which was not of the Holy Ghoſt, not to ſay that it is of Sin; and can it have a Feſtival when it is not Holy? The glorious Virgin will willingly be without this Honour, where either Sin is honoured, or Sanctity ſeems to be falſly brought in. This preſumed No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity will no ways pleaſe her againſt the Cuſtom of the Church; it is the Mother of Temerity, the Siſter of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,<pb n="101" facs="tcp:176007:55"/>the Daughter of Levity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<q rend="inline">Some have at ſome times celebrated the Feaſt of the <hi>Conception,</hi> and perhaps yet obſerve it; but it is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical nor approved, but rather ſeems to deſerve to be prohibited, for ſhe was conceived in Sin.</q>
               </p>

<q rend="inline">Some indeed make a Fifth Feaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Conception of bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> ſaying, That as we celebrate the Death of the Saints, not becauſe of their Death, but becauſe they are eternally happy; ſo in like manner the Feaſt of the Conception may be kept, not becauſe ſhe was conceived, or conceived in Sin; but becauſe ſhe was conceived the Mother of our Lord, affirming that this was revealed to a certain Abbot in danger of Shipwrack, which Story is not Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: So that this Feaſt is not to be approved, ſeeing ſhe was conceived in Sin, to wit, by the Commixture of Male and Female.</q>

               <head>SECT. II. <hi>Concerning the bleſſed Virgin's Nativity, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her Birth; with Remarks thereupon.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS we have hitherto found a great many bold Aſſertions obtruded on us without any cogent Proof; ſo the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt expect the ſame Entertainment ſtill; and it cannot well be otherwiſe, where both Scripture and ancient genuine Authorities are wholly ſilent, as they are in the Things that concern her Nativity. There are indeed Prophecies in the holy Bible concerning her, but not as ſhe is the <hi>Daughter of Anne,</hi> but the <hi>Mother of Jeſus;</hi> not to tell us how ſhe was conceived and born, but that a <hi>Virgin</hi> ſhould conceive, and <hi>the Holy one</hi> ſhould be born of her: Even the Verſes we now have of the pretended
<hi>Sibylls,</hi> ſay very little more than that of her.</p>
               <p>But the Men of this Church cannot be contented and at reſt, till they have filled every Stage of her Life with Wonder and Miracle. So they have done here in her Birth; the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whereof they make as glorious as poſſible may be, and to run parallel in moſt things with thoſe that are related of our Saviour. The oft-cited bold Jeſuit
<note n="a" place="margin">Pozae Eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar. l. 2. trac. 6. p.
494.</note> thinks it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to call her (what the Scripture calls the Meſſiah) <hi>The Deſire of all Nations;</hi> but, he adds, <hi>That this Woman was in their Wiſhes before her Son, though he was much more noble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Mankind.</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoiced to ſee the Day of Chriſt, he ſaw it and was glad; but long before</hi> Abraham, Adam
<hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>rejoiced to ſee the Day of</hi> Mary, <hi>they ſaw it and were glad.</hi> Wherein he is ſeconded by another of his Society,
<note n="b" place="margin">J. Bonifacius de vit. &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac. B. Virginis l. 1. c. 5.</note> ſaying, <hi>We ought to believe that</hi> Adam

                  <note n="c" place="margin">Chronic. Belgic. l. 31. c. 26.</note>, who tells us, that in the Year 1374. <hi>Sibylla</hi> Queen of

               </p>
               <p>Neither will theſe Prophecies ſuffice, unleſs Miracles alſo prepare her Way, and accompany her into the World. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxius</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Apparat. ad Annal. n. 40.</note> is contented to tell us in general, <hi>That great Things, and altogether admirable, ſuch as cannot worthily be expreſs'd, did precede the Birth of</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God:</hi> And every one that queſtions this, he brands for a <hi>Man of a narrow Soul, and for one out of his Wits.</hi> And his Reaſon for it is very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Becauſe we know that great and ſtrange Things went before the Birth of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Samuel, Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>John the Baptiſt;</hi> and who <hi>can think ſo abjectly and meanly of God, or be ſo mad as to affirm, That he did greater Things, and was more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to his Servants than to his Mother, to the Friends of the Bridegroom than to his Spouſe?</hi> (Or, if you will, to the

<note n="g" place="margin">Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. c. 1.</note>,
<hi>Every faithful Soul is a Handmaid of the Virgin; nay more, even the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church it ſelf.</hi>) If the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had been ſpeaking of the Graces that were neceſſary to make her beloved of God, or neceſſary to her Salvation, his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning might have been allowed; but ſpeaking of Gifts (the <hi>gratiae gratis datae,</hi> as the Schools ſpeak) which are meaſured by no Rule, but only the Pleaſure of God, who gives them as he thinks fit, being at perfect Liberty herein, both as to the Kind and the Degree; it is great Preſumption to argue and reaſon from what has been done for one, to what will be done for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Becauſe God may deny that, for ſecret Reaſons of his own, to one, which he may beſtow upon another: And thus, for Inſtance, he may reſolve to make <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Birth Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous by a Miracle, and to conceal that of the bleſſed Virgin, and therefore work none when ſhe was born. Not that I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that he did not, but that he not having told us that he<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176007:60"/>did, no Man can reaſon (unleſs he were as Wiſe as God, or a Privy-Councellor of Heaven) that God muſt do it, or if he does not, that he is too ſparing where he ought to be more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in his Donations. And I am afraid, upon theſe Principles and Arguings, we ſhall have but a ſorry Account, why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that were but <hi>Servants,</hi> had the Power given, not only of doing the ſame Works that the <hi>Son of God</hi> did, but <hi>greater than thoſe;</hi> which we are ſure is true, becauſe Chriſt foretold it; or why this bleſſed Mother did not work greater Miracles than any of the Apoſtles, which we are ſure ſhe did not, but ought to have had ſuch a Power given her, by the ſaid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> However he was ſo wiſe, as not to mention in particular any Miracle at her Birth, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that none could be produced, unleſs he made uſe of thoſe fabulous Authors to vouch for them, which he had before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded.</p>
               <p>But we have a Jeſuit
<note n="h" place="margin">Poza ib. l. 2. tract. 7. c. 1.</note> to help him out even here alſo, who ſeldom fails at a dead Lift, whoſe Fancy and Invention is ſo pregnant, that he can accommodate any wonderful Story to his Purpoſe: For <hi>Joſephus</hi>

<hi>Betheſda:</hi> This Wonder he will have, no body knows why, to happen in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> when the bleſſed Virgin was born; and having found in ſome Authors that <hi>Joachim</hi> had a Houſe by that Pool, and that ſhe was born there, he preſently concludes that this Miracle was yearly ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in honour of her Birth, and he thinks it firſt began at the time when ſhe was born, and that the Virtue that was in it to cure the Sick and Impotent that were let down into it, was contracted, <hi>ex vicinia hujus domus,</hi> by its Neighbourhood to this Houſe: He finds alſo a Myſtery in it

               <head>SECT. VI. <hi>Remarks on what their Offices and Authors ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bleſſed Virgin's Name.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE whole Diſcourſe of their Authors upon this Subject is made up of Two things, Folly and Profaneneſs. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by childiſh toying with the ſeveral Significations of the Virgin's Name, and finding great Myſteries in every Letter of it. Profaneneſs, by attributing thoſe Effects to the pronouncing and uſing of it, which makes it look like a Charm; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ſuch things to her Name, which can only be given to God and our Saviour; as we have ſeen in the foregoing Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and will further appear in the Sequel of our Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>That there was a Myſtery in our Saivour's Name, and that it was intended to be ſignificative to us, when he was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we are ſure, becauſe the Scripture tells us ſo: And a learned Man
<note n="a" place="margin">Rivet. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. pro S. virg. Maria l. 1. c 9.</note> has well obſerved, That as there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there of any Meſſage of an Angel to impoſe this Name of <hi>Mary</hi> on her; ſo if there had been any Myſtery in it, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would not have been ſilent, in all likelihood, to have declared it. The Name of <hi>Mary</hi> was a common Name at that time among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and many <hi>Maries</hi> are mentioned in the Goſpels; and as now the Names of the Apoſtles and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſons are given to Children, ſo it is probable that the Name of <hi>Mary</hi> was given to many of their Daughters in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Siſter <hi>Miriam,</hi> (for that is the ſame with
<hi>Mary.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But though there need be no further Inquiry into that, for the impoſing of which we read of no extraordinary Reaſon; yet this will not ſatisfie her <hi>Devoto's:</hi> They examine all the Significations of Hebrew Words from whence it can be derived, and commonly pitch upon that which is moſt improbable. <hi>Jerome Xaverius</hi>

<q rend="inline">That as the Number of the Beaſt is 666, and the Number of the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> 888, ſo the Number of
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Name is 999.</q> (How he makes this good he does not tell us, but) he inferrs from hence her Dignity; For, ſays he,
<q rend="inline">the Number Nine conſiſts of the Number Three (which is a moſt perfect Number agreeing to the divine Perſons) thrice repeated, and is attributed to the Orders of Angels; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhows, That the Mother of God is wholly celeſtial and Angelical; and then this Number Nine being thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, ſhews that this her Excellency and Dignity is both eminent and ſolid.</q>

               <p>Having thus found a great many fantaſtical Myſteries in that where none was ever intended, the next Work is to cry up this Name, and make it as venerable as poſſible; not only by the Ways now named, but by others which now ſhall follow.

When this Miſer died, and his Works came to be weighed, it was found that his good Works were leſs, and ſo was adjudged to the Devils to be tormented: But the bleſſed Virgin immediately appeared and brought a Loaf of Bread he had given for her ſake, and put it in the Balance, and immediately by her Merits the Scale was turned. She intreated her Son for him, who ſaid, <hi>I was hungry and he gave me no Meat,</hi> &amp;c. He ſhewed no Mercy, therefore deſerves to find none; to whom ſhe replied, <hi>I am the Mother of Mercy and he had me in great Devotion:</hi> And ſo he was releaſed and ſent into the Body again to repent and lead a better Life.
